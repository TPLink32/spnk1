*** Installing ***

To install this app:
- Unpack this file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- Restart Splunk


*** Configuring ***

To get the firewall data into Splunk:

- Configure a port on the Splunk server to listen for UDP or TCP traffic. If you
do not know how to do this, refer to the online documentation here:

  http://www.splunk.com/base/Documentation/latest/admin/MonitorNetworkPorts

Important: When you configure the input port, you must set the sourcetype of the
firewall data to srx_log. Otherwise, the app will not work. 

If you are using UDP input, you will also need to add:

  no_appending_timestamp = true

to the UDP stanza in your inputs.conf file. For example:

[udp://5155]
connection_host = ip
sourcetype = srx_log
no_appending_timestamp = true

- Next, configure the firewall device to direct log traffic to the Splunk server
on the network port that you specified.


*** Source types ***

As Splunk indexes your SRX firewall data, the app will rename the
sourcetypes to srx_threat or srx_traffic depending on the logging facility.


*** Search macros ***

The dashboards rely on the search macros for views. These macros are defined in 
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforJuniperSRX/default/macros.conf. 

You should only edit the base macros. If you already have data that has been 
indexed as a different sourcetype, add your sourcetype to the definition. 
For example:

  definition = sourcetype="srx_traffic" OR sourcetype="foo" OR sourcetype="bar"

Important: All other macros should not be edited.


*** Summary indexing ***

I haven't tested any of the SI stuff yet, so I don't know if it works.
