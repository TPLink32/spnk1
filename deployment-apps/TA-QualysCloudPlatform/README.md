| --- | --- |
| CIM version | 4.5 |
| Platforms | Linux |
| Vendor Products | Qualys |
| Lookup file changes | qualys_kb.csv contains knowledgebase, qualys_severity.csv contains numeric severity to verbal severity mapping |

##### New features

TA-QualysCloudPlatform includes the following new features:

- Use storage/passwords endpoint to store API credentials. This uses Splunk's own encryption and more safe than earlier versions.
- Ingest Information Gathered (IGs) events in Host Detection as well as WAS Findings. Now, IGs will come in by default. If you do not want them, you need to make use of extra parameters and set show_igs=0 explicitly.
- New run.py to debug this TA. For more details, go to TA directory and run: SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd python ./bin/run.py -h
- More compatible to Splunk ES app: Adaptive Response custom action to apply given tag ids to high/critical severity web apps


##### Fixed issues

Version 1.1.0 of the TA-QualysCloudPlatform fixes the following issues:

- WAS Findings: while fetching WAS findings using multiple threads, the Web app IDs were getting mixed up among threads, leading to incorrect and incomplete data.
- To be more CIM compliant, added required extraction field which was missing earlier: 'vendor_product'.
- TA log location changed from /tmp to SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_QualysCloudPlatform.log.
- Write important activities in above mentioned log.
- To make TA more ES compatible, severity mapping changed to following: 1 = informational, 2 = low, 3 = medium, 4 = high, 5 = critical.

##### Third-party software attributions

Version 1.1.0 of the TA-QualysCloudPlatform incorporates no third-party software or libraries.
