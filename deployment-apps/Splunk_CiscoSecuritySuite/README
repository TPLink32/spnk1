3) Restart your server
4) Logon to your Splunk Instance
5) Follow the instructions within the app under Cisco Security Suite -> Documentation

+++ Important Note about Upgrading +++

Several of the Cisco TA's in the past recorded events with a sourcetype of (for example) cisco_asa.  The new TA's use
the ES3 compliant sourcetype (for example) cisco:asa.  If you want to view your old events, then alter the various
eventtypes included in the packages so that they include the old data.
