<h1>Welcome to the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This application for Splunk Enterprise 6 covers Cisco Firewalls, the Web Security Appliance, and Cisco Identity Services.  Firewalls
include the Cisco ASA 5500 series, FWSM 3.x and 4.x, and Cisco PIX 5.0 and higher.  This is a complete re-write 
of the Cisco Security Suite to take advantage of the Common Information Model (CIM) and designed to be compatible
with the data models in the <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1621/" target="_blank">CIM app</a> and <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/263/" target="_blank">Enterprise Security 3.x</a>.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading from versions prior to 3.0.x</h2>
<p>
If you are upgrading from a version prior to 3.0.x, you will need to understand exactly what changes have been made to the underlying data
so that you can decide how to deal with the old data.  Please refer to the <a href="upgrading">Upgrading</a> page
for more information.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
With any Splunk app, there are 2 parts:
<ol>
<li>Data collection</li>
<li>Data visualization/analytics</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>
The Cisco Security Suite for Splunk is not configured for any data collection by default.

Extra apps known as technology add-ons (TA) must be downloaded to collect data for the various Cisco products.  TAs are responsible for collecting data and usually do not have any visualizations.  The Cisco Security Suite for Splunk
does not contain any TAs itself.  These TAs must be downloaded and installed separately for each product type you want to use in the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk.  Links to the specific TAs
needed for the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk are listed in the steps below detailing setups.
